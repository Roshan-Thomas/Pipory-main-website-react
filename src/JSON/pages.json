[{"content":"One Random Phone Call that’s where it all began ...\r\nAfter being friends for years and add a couple of more years to not staying in touch. One day we decided to get on a call and that was where we understood that beneath that engineering student exterior was an entrepreneur waiting to try out something new.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nWhat was supposed to be One call every 4 months became a call every 4 weeks and eventually every day.Right from the Medical Industry to the Movie Industry, you name it we had an idea in almost all of them but nothing seemed like ‘this is it, that is our idea’.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nApart from being students, we loved Photography and writing. While Charlie Puth did release “One Call Away” 5 years back.Who ever knew that we were actually just One phone call away from finalizing our idea.People come up with ideas everyday sometimes by observing , reflecting and contemplating. But it took us 4 sentences.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSK: *Why aren’t you posting on your art account anymore ?*\r\n<br>\r\nSS: *Idk,No one really cares about it*\r\n<br>\r\nSS: *Dude..*\r\n<br>\r\nSS: *Are you thinking what I am thinking?*\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\nAnd Baam .. Thats our story ’s when we came up with this idea of encouraging creative minds in a world filled with conventional wisdom and talents rusted by our education system. Being from a country that produces one of the best engineers and doctors, there is not enough cultural advancement to flourish and enrich the creative minds born here. Moving forward we aim to give all the poets, artists, writers, memers, photographers, a platform to Cultivate, enrich and enhance their creative skills.\r\n"},{"content":"- A Short term online marketing internship for anyone interested\r\n- Connection with our tightknit community of marketing interns from different parts of    the country.\r\n- An in-Depth view of how a Start-up like Pipory works.\r\n- Internship Certificate after completing the challenge successfully.\r\n"}]
